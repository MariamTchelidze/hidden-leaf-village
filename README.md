For building this application, I have used  mobile-first-design principe, starting from mobile resolution and ending with desktop(1920).
For the project, I have used the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS3
- JS (just basic functions for burger menu)

- JS part was the biggest challenge for me in this homework, as I have not used it for years, but I actually managed to restore the knowledge, and for this, I used Stack Overflow's & AI help for this.
